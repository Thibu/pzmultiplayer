This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Steam News endpoint

The app exposes a cached API at `/api/steam-news` that fetches from Steam and serves content to the UI (`app/modules/home/services/home.services.ts`).

### Behavior

- The route always fetches fresh data from Steam.

### Required environment variables

Add these to your deployment environment:

```
STEAM_UPSTREAM_NEWS_URL=<full Steam Web API news URL>
```

Example Steam upstream for Project Zomboid (replace with your app id and params):

```
https://api.steampowered.com/ISteamNews/GetNewsForApp/v2/?appid=108600&count=30&feeds=steam_community_announcements
```
